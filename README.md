# 3D Protein
---
### Todo:
- [ ] add splash screen with custom logo
- [ ] add FingerPrint authentication.
- [ ] list ligands from [./const/ligands.json](./const/ligands.json)
- [ ] search bar to search a specefic ligand from list
- [ ] if a ligand is selected (clicked) move to render page
- [ ] render in 3d the structure of protein by fetching the PDB data by ligand

### Conclusion:
there will be 3 screens (pages):
1. splash screen
2. Listing screen
3. Render screen
